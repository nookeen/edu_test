Dark matter could be white dwarfs, the remnants of cores of dead small- to medium-size stars. Or dark matter could be neutron stars or black holes, the remnants of large stars after they explode.</p>\n<p>However, problems exist with each of these suggestions. Scientists have strong evidence there aren't enough brown dwarfs or white dwarfs to account for all the dark matter. Black holes and neutron stars, too, are rare.</p>\n<p>Dark matter may not be made up of the matter we are familiar with at all. The matter that makes up dark matter could different.

Other than that, it is a complete mystery. But it is an important mystery. It turns out that roughly 68% of the universe is dark energy. Dark matter makes up about 27%. The rest - everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, all normal matter - adds up to less than 5% of the universe. Come to think of it, maybe it shouldn't be called \"normal\" matter at all, since it is such a small fraction of the universe.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/images/test1-q2-img1.png\" alt=\"Big Bang Illustration\"></p>\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/image_file/image_attachment/6753/pdf.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hvi/uploads/image_file/image_attachment/6753/pdf.pdf</a></li>\n      </ul>\n</ul>",

        questionTitle: 'What is a Black Hole?',
        questionContent: "\n<p>A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.<br>Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars.<br>Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or \"stuff,\" in an object.</p>\n<p>Another kind of black hole is called \"stellar.\" Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the Milky Way.</p>\n<p>The largest black holes are called \"supermassive.\" These black holes have masses that are more than 1 million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths.</p>\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Nasa's Website\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-k4.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

        questionContent: "\n      \n      <p>It was September 2011 and physicist Antonio Ereditato had just shocked the world.<br>The announcement he had made promised to overturn our understanding of the Universe. If the data gathered by 160 scientists working on the OPERA project were correct, the unthinkable had been observed.</p>\n<p>Particles Ð in this case, neutrinos Ð had travelled faster than light.According to Einstein's theories of relativity, this should not have been possible. And the implications for showing it had happened were vast. Many bits of physics might have to be reconsidered.</p>\n<p>In the end, it turned out the OPERA result was wrong. A timing problem had been caused by a poorly connected cable that should have been transmitting accurate signals from GPS satellites.<br>There was an unexpected delay in the signal. As a consequence, the measurements of how long the neutrinos took to travel the given distance were off by about 73 nanoseconds, making it look as though they had whizzed along more quickly than light could have done.</p>\n<p>Let's take the second of those questions first. The speed of light in a vacuum is 299,792.458 km (186,282.397 mi) per second Ð just shy of a nice round 300,000km/s figure. That is pretty nippy. The Sun is 150 million km (about 93,000,000 mi) away from Earth and light takes just eight minutes and 20 seconds to travel that far.</p>\n<h3>Sources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"BCC's website\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160429-the-real-reasons-nothing-can-ever-go-faster-than-light\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160429-the-real-reasons-nothing-can-ever-go-faster-than-light</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
